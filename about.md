title: About Me 
---

Hello, 

I'm Yinka, an engineer based in [Lagos, Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos). I'm a self taught full stack web developer, and I work with (and write about) technologies like PHP, JavaScript, Python and C. I currently work at [the largest online hotel booking agency in Nigeria](https://hotels.ng).

I love to try new things, and invent stuff.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/olayinkaos), [Github](http://github.com/olayinkaos), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/olayinkaos) and [Medium](http://medium.com/@olayinka.omole). You can also just send me a mail if you want to discuss anything interesting - [me@olayinkaos.com](mailto:me@olayinkaos.com).

Here's a photo of me at the beach:
