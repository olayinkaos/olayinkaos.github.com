Me and [Ibiyemi](https://twitter.com/morado_luv) used to have this thing where we would challenge ourselves to different tasks, and whoever didn't complete his/her task would have to do/buy something for the other person. I lost so many times (I was scared I was gonna run into debt) so I stopped. 

See I'm trying to repay all by debts and become a healthier person, so I'm gonna be writing about her in this post -- as payment to one of such losses. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Š

I met Iby late last year, when I joined HNG, and can't say we hit it off immediately. She was the super efficient coder that was always listening and singing aloud to Jon Bellion's ["Woke the fuck up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axKguLdeMEY). I can't say at what point exactly, but as time went by, I began to rely on her more and more at work for help (as everyone else did), and we just became much closer.

You know there are friends you call when you want to go out and have fun, and other ones you call when you need help with work, or when you wanna just be sappy and talk about insecurities. Iby is all those people all in one. She's unusally intelligent, and it's out of this world.

We've done everything from reading books and trying to write stories together, to playing all the nerd party games in the world (I win these ones everytime (also, I can lie, it's my blog)), to learning Python, to working on my weird ass ideas.

It's comforting to have someone who maybe doesn't get you all the time, but at least makes a genuine effort 100% of the time.

I'm gonna stop here before I start getting too corny. Thank you Iby. You can mention her [@morado_luv](https://twitter.com/morado_luv) to say hello too.
