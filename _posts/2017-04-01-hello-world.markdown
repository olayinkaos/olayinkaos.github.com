What better way to start the new month than with a shiny new Jekyll powered blog? I know, right?

I finally decided to take a step further in this writing thing by creating a personal blog. One of my goals for this year was to write more, it helps give your thoughts clarity, people said. 

Surprisingly I've not done too badly in meeting that goal. I started writing for [Sitepoint](http://sitepoint.com)[^a] and [Pusher](http://blog.pusher.com)[^b], and also started [a tech blog](http://forbeginners.co), all in the first quarter. My plan for this quarter is to write more non-technical articles. The ones that don't require days of Googling and peer review.

I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to scratch my tinkering itch, and was also inspired by [this post by Ope](http://obem.be/2013/02/20/moved.html). It's great that I get to write in Markdown, and not worry about what editor to use. Code highlighting, disqus comments, and social sharing are also taken care of with this theme, so I don't have to worry about those. Github provides free hosting for static sites too... another win for Jekyll. I plan to write about the entire process of creating the blog, from theme selection to hosting on Github, and all the procrastination in between, so check back soon.

Shoutout to [Ibiyemi](http://twitter.com/morado_luv), for joining me on this Jekyll blog creation journey ðŸ˜€. Hers should be up any second now...
