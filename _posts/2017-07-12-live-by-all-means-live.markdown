Today was tough.

I was in church was the news came in on the group chat. I thought it was a joke. I mean, he was laughing with us just some days ago (or was it weeks?), he can't be gone. It wasn't till I got home hours later that the news became real to me. I broke down. Fuck.

I'm finding it very hard to come to terms with this. But hopefully writing this will provide some clarity for my mind.

Mubarak was a good one. He still had so much to give to this world. He cared deeply about people. I didn't talk with him so much, but I knew him since 2014. He was the genius designer my boss couldn't stop talking about, and he never stopped growing. He was always smiling, always making people smile.

Today was a real reminder... no one is going to be in this world forever. No matter how careful or smart or wealthy you are, no matter how much you plan and prepare, some day we will all leave. Do what you can while you can.

I remember Mubarak for his kindness, his selflessness in teaching, his brilliance. What will I be remembered for? No one cares about what you owned when you leave, they only care about what you did.

Live on in our hearts, Mubarak. We will continue what you started. We will impart lives, and try to make this world a better place. We will keep living and will make you proud before we leave this earth.
